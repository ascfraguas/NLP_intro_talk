# intro-to-nlp

Contents in this project aim to give a quick a headstart in the NLP by discussing its mathematical framework, place in the ML paradigm, fields of 
applications, recent advances and practical examples of text featurization. The contents end with a simple instantiation of an `sklearn` model
leveraging the discussed features. 

This talk was given to Clarity.ai on February 27th, 2020, as a part of the Clarity Tech Thursdays initiative, with Diego PÃ©rez and myself as ponents.
